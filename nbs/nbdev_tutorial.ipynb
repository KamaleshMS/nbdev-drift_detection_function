    "\n",
    "> - Import Errors: This error occurs when you try to import a module or function that is not properly defined or not present in the generated Python modules. It can happen if you forget to add the #| export directive to the code cell containing the function or if there is a typo in the import statement.\n",
    "\n",
    ">> - Solution: Double-check that the code cell defining the function has the #| export directive. Also, verify that the import statement in the notebook or in other modules is correctly referencing the function from the generated Python modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "> - Build Failures: Sometimes, during the nbdev_build_lib step, you may encounter build failures due to syntax errors, unresolved dependencies, or incompatible code.\n",
    "\n",
    ">> - Solution: Review the error message to identify the cause of the build failure. Check for syntax errors in your code, ensure that all required dependencies are specified in the settings.ini file, and resolve any compatibility issues. Once you fix the errors, run nbdev_build_lib again.\n",
    "\n",
    "> - Documentation Formatting Issues: If you encounter issues with the formatting of your generated documentation, such as incorrect rendering of Markdown cells, missing sections, or broken links, it could be due to incorrect formatting or missing metadata in the notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    ">> - Solution: Review your notebooks and ensure that the Markdown cells are properly formatted with appropriate headings, bullet points, and links. Verify that the notebook metadata, such as toc, title, and keywords, are correctly specified. Rerun the necessary cells or notebooks to regenerate the documentation with the correct formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "> - Failure in Tests: If your tests fail during the nbdev_test_nbs step, it means that the code in your notebooks is not producing the expected output or behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    ">> - Solution: Review the failed tests and the associated error messages to identify the cause of the failure. Check your code for logical errors, incorrect calculations, or missing assertions. Modify your code or test cases accordingly until the tests pass successfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "> - GitHub Action Workflow Errors: While working with GitHub Actions, you may encounter errors related to workflow setup, configuration, or dependency management.\n",
    "\n",
    ">> - Solution: Review the workflow files (usually located in the .github/workflows directory) and ensure that the configurations are correct. Check for any typos, missing dependencies, or incorrect setup steps. Additionally, refer to the GitHub Actions documentation for troubleshooting guidance specific to your issue.\n",
    "\n",
